# Stock API Error Handling Improvements

This document outlines the enhanced error handling mechanisms implemented in the stock API endpoints to improve resilience and reliability.

## NSE Route Improvements

The NSE stock API route has been enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Timeout Management**:

   - Added AbortController with 10-second timeout for all fetch requests
   - Properly clearing timeouts to prevent memory leaks
   - Handling aborted requests gracefully

2. **Improved Session Management**:

   - Better error handling during session establishment
   - Automatic session refreshing on 401 errors
   - Cascading fallbacks to ensure data availability

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:

   - Specific error handling for different failure scenarios (network, timeout, parse errors)
   - Graceful degradation with mock data when API calls fail
   - Improved error logging for easier debugging

4. **Data Resilience**:
   - Added JSON parsing error handling
   - Structured mock data with proper types
   - Source attribution for mock data to aid in debugging

## BSE Route Improvements

Similar improvements have been made to the BSE API route:

1. **Timeout Management**:

   - Added AbortController with 10-second timeout
   - Proper cleanup of timeouts

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:

   - Better HTTP status code handling
   - Graceful degradation to mock data
   - Clearer error messages

3. **Data Resilience**:
   - Added JSON parsing error handling
   - Proper typing for mock data
   - Better source attribution

## Fallback Mechanism

Both routes now implement a robust fallback mechanism:

1. When an API call fails, mock data is returned instead of throwing an error
2. The mock data is properly typed and structured to match the expected format
3. The source of the data is clearly indicated to help with debugging

## Benefits

These improvements provide the following benefits:

1. **Improved User Experience**: The UI will not break when external APIs are unavailable
2. **Better Resilience**: The application can handle API rate limiting, network issues, and timeouts
3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Clear error messages and source attribution make troubleshooting easier
4. **Type Safety**: Proper typing for mock data ensures consistent data structures

## Testing

You can test these improvements by:

1. Simulating network failures
2. Setting very low timeout values
3. Using invalid stock symbols
4. Checking the application behavior when the external APIs are down

This enhanced error handling ensures that the stock screener components will continue to function even when the external NSE and BSE APIs experience issues.
