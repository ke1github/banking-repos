# Icon System Optimization

This document outlines the optimization of the icon system in the banking application.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Duplicate Icons**: Removed many SVG icons from the `/public/icons/` directory that were duplicated by the Lucide React library.

2. **Optimized Icon Component**: Updated the `Icon` component to use Lucide React icons as the primary source and only fall back to the file system when necessary.

3. **Prioritized Rendering Order**: Changed the icon rendering approach to:
   - First attempt to use a Lucide React icon
   - Only if no matching Lucide icon is found, try to load from the public directory

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Fewer static assets to load
2. **Improved Performance**: In-memory React components are faster than loading separate SVG files
3. **Better Consistency**: Using a single icon library ensures visual consistency
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: Easier to maintain one source of icons rather than two parallel systems

## Remaining Icons

The following special icons remain in the `/public/icons/` directory as they are unique and not available in Lucide:

- Social media icons (facebook.svg, twitter.svg, linkedin.svg, instagram.svg)
- Payment method icons (visa.svg, mastercard.svg, amex.svg)
- Brand icons (apple.svg, google.svg, google-play.svg)
- Special visual elements (gradient-mesh.svg, Lines.svg)
- Custom application icons (logo.svg, logout.svg)

## Future Improvements

In the future, we could:

1. Consider adopting a more comprehensive icon library
2. Create a more structured naming convention for icons
3. Implement better error handling for missing icons
4. Create a catalog page to view all available icons
