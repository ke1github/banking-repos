# Cleanup Instructions

This document provides guidance on removing unnecessary example files and consolidating documentation in the SP Banking App.

## Files to Remove

1. **Example Files**

   - `/app/avatar-examples/page.tsx` - Avatar component examples
   - `/components/examples/` directory with all files:
     - `AccountsExample.tsx`
     - `ConnectedBanksExample.tsx`
     - `RecentTransactionsWithHOC.tsx`
     - `TransactionsExample.tsx`

2. **Redundant Documentation**

   - `/DOCUMENTATION.md` - Main documentation file (to be consolidated)
   - `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of implementation (to be consolidated)
   - `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide (to be consolidated)
   - `/docs/DATA_RENDERING.md` - Data rendering docs (to be consolidated)

## Consolidated Documentation

The documentation has been consolidated into these files:

1. **README.md** - Main project overview and quick start guide
2. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture and design patterns
3. **docs/COMPONENTS.md** - Reusable components documentation
4. **docs/AUTHENTICATION.md** - Authentication system documentation

## Cleanup Process

### Automatic Method

Run the provided cleanup script:

```bash
# On Linux/Mac
chmod +x cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh

# On Windows (PowerShell)
# Convert to PowerShell and run:
# .\cleanup.ps1
```

### Manual Method

1. Create a backup of files to be removed
2. Delete the example files and directories
3. Replace README.md with the new version
4. Delete redundant documentation files

## Verifying the Cleanup

After cleanup, ensure:

1. All important documentation is preserved in the consolidated files
2. No critical information was lost in the process
3. The application still functions correctly (examples were not referenced anywhere)
4. Update any links or references to the old documentation files
